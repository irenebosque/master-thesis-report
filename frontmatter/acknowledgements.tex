It was an event of chance that I ended up attending the course \textit{Knowledge-Based Control Systems} of professor Jens Kober. I remember doubting until the last minute to enrol in his class and, I could not be happier to have decided to take it. This course was my first contact with machine learning, a world until then unknown to me and which I wish to continue exploring. I am profoundly grateful to my daily supervisors Carlos Celemin and Rodrigo PÃ©rez-Dattari, for their invaluable insight, interesting discussions and corrective feedback. Immense gratitude goes towards my parents and sister because, without their support, this work would not have been possible.
My final thanks go to Lidia for accompanying me every day despite the kilometers in between.
