\section{Results of validation in real system}
\label{section:results_kuka}

To validate the proposed R-CIdL algorithm in a real system, we taught the 2 planar manipulation tasks described in sections \ref{subsection:Park a box} and \ref{subsection:Push box in a straight line}. The human teaching provided the necessary corrections to the position of the end effector via a joystik. In this subsection we show the results obtained for both tasks and because the objective is simply to validate R-CIdL, we did not performed comparisons with other methods. 



 Based on some initial trials, a correction magnitude (i.e. error constant e) of 5 centimeters is found to work well for the task. The minimum height of the end effector is limited such that the ball does not hit the ground plane. For safety reasons, the joint angles are also limited to between zero and 90 degrees. To avoid the ball rolling off the sides of the cup and thus moving

\subsection{Task 1: Push a box}
\label{subsection:results_kuka_push}


165 episodes, evaluation every 5 episodes

7365 feedback signals
Accumulated timesteps 13135
e 0.5, buffer 10000 that never gets fully complete meaning that all the feedback provided is used to update the HumanModel
Average timesteps per episode 72

aprox 20 secs per episode

at episode 60, 23 min the slope of the curve starts increasing until 130 episode (47 min) when the percentage of success is 80% aprox

\subsection{Task 1: Park a box}
\label{subsection:results_kuka_park}


From the last episodes of the training, pick the one that seems to show the last best performance, in this case, the episode number 63
3. Perform the evaluations, evaluating every 5 episodes. For this task I did 5 evaluations

At minute 25 the performance increases drastically. This point corresponds with the moment tha the agent learns to go around the corner, Until then all episodes logically fail
At episode 37, the performance has reached its maximum as all the following episodes are succesful.

Here the parameter e was find to work best with a value of 0.3

3390 feedback signals.
